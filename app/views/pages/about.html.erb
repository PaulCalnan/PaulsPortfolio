        <p>Although a late starter to a career in coding, I've finally arrived at the place where I was always meant to be.</p>

        <p>From a young age I've always had a natural ability towards understanding anything and everything involving computers and electronics.
          I believe I must have pulled apart every single electronic device I've ever owned.<br>Some of them never worked the same again!
        </p>
        <p>
        Around the age of 12 my first computer was the popular Commodore 64.
        I must have spent a good part of my childhood trying to work out BASIC computer language and also pulling the machine to bits to see what made it tick.<br>
        My very first programs written in BASIC revolved around amazing my friends with nifty little 'if-then-else' statements where you could get a response from entering data.<br>
        As for complex programs like games, I would spend more time looking at the code wondering how it all worked than playing the game.
        With no understanding of the underlying code I would change different values within the code and then run the program to see what had changed within the game,
        (if it would run again at all!)<br>
        The internet was non existant at this time of my life and anything I wanted to know with regard to coding was picked up from books or magazines.</p>

        <p>Moving on through my teen years, coding and tinkering became a side hobby as it was finally time to venture out into the real world and get a job.<br>
          I was soon offered a position as an Electrical Apprentice and I grabbed the offer.<br>
          After many years I have gained a broad range of skills across all facets of the electrical industry.
          To my advantage, skills mastered during my electrical career are equally valuable within coding.<br>
          Applying logical thought with regard to circuit design or fault finding.
          The ability to deal with people, to listen and interpret client needs.
          Thinking outside of the box to provide solutions to problems are all of benefit and transferrable to the coding world.</p>

        <p>Now after 20 years working within the electrical industry, a career move into coding is well overdue.</p>
